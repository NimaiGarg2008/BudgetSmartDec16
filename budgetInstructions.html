			You are Alex, a young teen who lives in a neighborhood with your hardworking mom. When you start driving,
			one day, your mom asks you to take on an important task: buy the week's groceries--but with a catch: you only
			can spend your allowance, since your mom doesn't have enough.

			Your mission is clear: Get the essentials for this week without going over the budget. Your mom has a list of
			items she needs which you grab and put in your pocket. You'll have to figure out how to balance everything in
			your shopping cart, while ensuring your mom is satisified.

			You will be running some errands at a grocery store. In each session, you will be given a set, 
			randomized <strong>budget</strong>, as well as a set, randomized <strong>shopping list</strong>. But
			the twist is that the shopping list includes different food categories, not specific items. Your goal is to
			get the exact amount of every food category specified in the shopping list, while not straying from the budget
			you've been given. <br></br> Along with this, every item in the store has a <strong>"desirability"</strong>
			meter below it. The greater the price of an item, the higher desirability it has. Every time you play the game,
			there is a secret randomized overall desirability target which you need to hit in order to pass the level, so
			you should also try to aim for as high of a total desirability as you can while still keeping within your budget.
			Don't worry, though - if you try to maximize desirability even a little bit, then you should be able to exceed
			the desirability target without even knowing what it is!
		</p>
		
		<h2 id = "controls"><u> Controls </u></h2>
		<p id = "controls-text">
			Use left and right arrow keys in the <strong>"Store Items"</strong> section to toggle back and forth between various
			items.			
			<br></br>
			For your convenince, the "Store Items" section has a <strong>dropdown menu</strong> where you can click on a 
			category to view the products for that category starting from the first one.
			<br></br>				
			When you click the <strong>"Add To Cart"</strong> button on an item, the <strong>"Items In Cart"</strong> 
			section will display the item you bought, along with its price and a <strong>"Remove"</strong> button. 
			Use this button to remove the item from the cart.
			<br></br>
			At the bottom of the "Items In Cart" section is the <strong>"Checkout"</strong> button. Click this when 
			you are sure  you have met the budget requirements and maximized the total desirability to the best of 
			your ability. If you over-exceed the budget or add items that aren't on the list, you lose the game and 
			will have to try again, so double check the shopping list on the left and the budget on the top left!
			<br></br>
			You will be given <strong>3 minutes</strong> at most. With those basics out of the way, it's time 
			to start shopping smarter!
